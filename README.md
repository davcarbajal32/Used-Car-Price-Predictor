# Fire-Risk-Predictor

Abstract: 
This project focuses on developing a Used Car Price Predictor, a machine learning model designed to estimate the market value of used vehicles based on their features such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, etc. The purpose of this model is to assist consumers, dealerships, and online marketplaces in determining fair prices in the rapidly changing used car market. Using a large dataset of historical vehicle listings, the project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and regression-based predictive modeling techniques to identify patterns that influence car prices. Index Terms: machine learning, regression, decision-tree, neural-network

Introduction: 
The goal of this project is to develop a model, Used Car Price Predictor, that accurately finds the market value for a used car based on its attributes. The used car market continues to expand and fluctuate due to current economic conditions, demand, and supply chain challenges, it becomes important for buyers to have a reliable way to assess reasonably priced used vehicles. Our motivation stems from the increasingly expensive car market and the need for a data-driven solution that promotes transparency and informed decision making for consumers wanting to purchase a car. Our model utilizes data from the data source [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taeefnajib/used-car-price-prediction-dataset]. 

Dataset details:
Dataset: Used Car Price Predictor Model 
The data set for this project contains over 4,000 different used car listings and provides a wide range of features such as brand / model, model year, mileage, fuel type, engine type, transmission, exterior / interior colors, accident history, and title status. Our immediate goal with this data set is to identify the most influential features that prove to have the strongest relationships with the vehicle prices / listings. Once these features are identified, we will use them to train our machine learning model to best calculate and predict used car prices.

Methodology:
Regression analysis will be used to construct a model. In python, the mean squared error provided by regression can be used to determine the residual squared error and run F-tests which can determine which features should be kept or removed. The model constructed during this process can be compared with other models such as a neural network to predict a valid price range. Accuracy can be determined by whether the true value is within the range.
